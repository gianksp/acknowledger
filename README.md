# Acknowledger ü•≥ (A SuperHack 2023 Project)

*Great Cultures Starts with Acknowledgement*

**Acknowledger** is a peer-to-peer recognition platform tailored to community values, culture, and performance. Designed for SuperHack 2023 by Giancarlo.

In essence, is a project that leverage NFTs that people can mint for others. These NFTs generated are soulbound and capture a peace of feedback, kudos, recognition from the sender.

The recipient captures all these testimonials in a public, shareable wall that is timeless since data is fully stored in blockchain.

ChatGPT is used to generate a summarized 2 liner of all the testimonial provided by people for the recipient.
